# Multiplayer Gold Rush
## Introduction
This repo contains a frontend and backend for a multiplayer Gold Rush game. It uses Typescript, Koa, routing-controllers and TypeORM in the backend and React/Redux in the frontend. The backend exposes a REST API but also sends messages over websockets using SocketIO.

## Playing the game
1. download the repo
2. create a docker
3. In the terminal, go to the client folder and run the React app `yarn start`
4. At the very beginning, you need to comment out part of the Player entity in the `/server/src/games/entities`:

    *@Column()

    userId: number*
5. In another terminal, go to the server folder and run `yarn watch`
6. In the third terminal, go to the server folder and run `nodemon .`
7. After the tables are created, uncomment part 4.
8. sign up as a new user.
9. copy your ip address (find in the terminal after running yarn start in part 3) and paste it in the `/client/src/constants.js` file as a baseUrl.
10. share your ip address with your friend.
9. Enjoy playing the game

## To do
1. fix the commenting and uncommenting mentioned in part 4 and 7 in the Playing the game section
2. make a Material-UI model which appears after the game finishes and shows the winner.
3. Make a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
   - Easy: the current game
   - Medium: the number of bombs are doubled
   - Hard: the location of gold/bombs/diamond will change after a short time (even without clicking any mouse button)
4. Ask for player's name and show them on top
5. More than two users can play the game
